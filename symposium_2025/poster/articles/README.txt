Traditionally, Topic Modeling was done with LDA. Then, transformers changed the field (THE paper):
Vaswani (2023), Attention is All You Need

Methods (Topic Modeling) for LARGE datasets (probably won't use this, but can introduce):
Eshima, Sasaki, & Imai (2024), Keyword-Assisted Topic Models

Introduce LLMs:
Linegar, Kocielnik, & Alvarez (2023), LLMs & Political Science

Methods (LLMs):
Tornberg (2023), How to use Large Language Models for Text Analysis
Mellon et al. (2024), Using Language Models to Code Open-Text Social Survey Responses at Scale
Bedemariam (2025), Potential and Perils of Large Language Models as Judges

Caution on LLMs (closed-source models):
Palmer et al. (2022), Using proprietary language models in academic research requires explicit justification

Open-source models justification:
Spirling (2023), Why open-source generative AI models are an ethical way forward for science
